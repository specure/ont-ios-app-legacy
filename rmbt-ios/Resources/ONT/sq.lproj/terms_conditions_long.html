        </h2>
        <p align="justify">
        The Agency for Communication Networks and Services (<em>Agencija za komunikacijska omre≈æja in storitve Republike Slovenije</em>; Example) offers users the
        opportunity to use the Example Test Net software to test the quality and capacity of their current broadband connection. Children under 15 can use the Example
        Test Net with parental consent or consent of their legal guardian.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
        Using Example Test Net on mobile devices may cause consumption of large data amount. By using it on 3G technology the usual data amount would be between 5 and
        10 MB. On 4G data amount may exceed <strong>100 MB</strong>. Both assumptions are done using quality service. Agency takes no responsibility for large data consumption done
        by user and therefore related costs.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
        Example Test Net provides users with transparent and detailed information on the current quality of their broadband access service while respecting their privacy. The test is based
        on the open source and open data principle. Open source principle means that the source code of Example Test Net software is published completely. This is mainly for transparency
        and reliability issues. Any commercial use of Example Test Net source code, which is published under the MAME license, is not allowed. The Example Test Net logo and font are not subject
        to the open source and open data principle and copying, modifying or processing them in changed or unchanged form is strictly prohibited. Example Test Net measurement results data

        responsible for the management of the database. Users and the Agency shall use the Example Test Net system to measure the capacity and quality of network
        services provided by operators or service providers. The Agency shall use the collected data in order to monitor the situation and to carry out regulatory
        supervision in the field of fixed or mobile broadband services. The system shall show the Agency where in Slovenia and with which ISPs there are potential
        problems with access to internet services, where there is no mobile or wireless signal and whether operators are expanding the coverage of the specified
        white spots with mobile and wireless access pursuant to decisions on the assignment of radio frequencies.

        The user's public IP address is being processed in order to determine the network operator, to identify potential improper use of the system and in order
        to prepare a history of measurements for a specific user. After the completed test the <strong>only the network address</strong> of the IP address
        (anonymised public IP address) is recorded in the database and can be accessed in accordance with the open data principle. The full IP address is recorded
        in the primary database, but shall not be disclosed to public and can be viewed by the user only in the mobile app under "Details" or in the browser under
        the "History" tab.

        The NDT Test is provided by M-Lab, which also processes and publishes data acquired with the test.

        <p align="justify">
        M-Lab is a consortium of partners (New America Foundation's Open Technology Institute, PlanetLab Consortium, Google Inc. and academic researchers from the
        research, industry and public sector and constitutes an ecosystem for independent monitoring of the operation of the global Internet. The operation of
        M-Lab depends primarily on the support and participation of likeminded people and organisations. Within M-Lab researchers can publish their open-source
        tools for monitoring internet services. The data acquired with these tools are published. The mission of M-Lab is to carry out advanced research of the
        internet and provide of useful information on broadband access to the general and interested public.

        You can find more information on the NDT Test methodology on the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/ndt/wiki/NDTTestMethodology">M-Lab</a> website. Data
        processed during the NDT Test are transmitted to the M-Lab research platform (<a href="http://www.measurementlab.net">www.measurementlab.net</a>). This
        means that these data are <strong>published by M-Lab and made freely accessible to the general public</strong> for information, use, dissemination and
        other applications under <a href="http://www.measurementlab.net/privacy">M-Lab Privacy Policy</a>. The measurement data are accessible online through the
        M-Lab platform website: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/m-lab/wiki/HowToAccessMLabData">https://code.google.com/p/m-lab/wiki/HowToAccessMLabData</a>.
        Example Test Net Android app processes and transmits results of the NDT Test, which are visible for each specific test in the mobile app under the 'Details'
        section. These results are also visible in the 'History' tab of the browser version if the user synchronised measurement results from several devices.

        During the NDT-Test the IP address, which is allocated to the mobile terminal, is processed and transmitted to the M-Lab research platform outside the EU.
        This means that these data are <strong>permanently stored</strong> and <strong>published</strong> by M-Lab and are made freely accessible to the general
        public for information, use, dissemination and other applications under the M-Lab-Open Data policy. The data protection requirements in non-EU countries
        may be less strict than in the EU. Because the IP address is processed and transmitted outside the EU, this may mean that the identity of the user of the
        Example Test Net can be identified or is potentially identifiable, which could result in being able to establish the user‚Äôs personal identity within the
        meaning of Article 6 of the Personal Data Protection Act (ZVOP-1).

        <p align="justify">
        Test results acquired by Example Test Net are solely of informative and
        illustrative purposes as there are too many technical parameters undefined on the user side.
        Therefore test results doesn't represent any legal proof of broadband connection speed which
        could lead to any consumer complaints cases represented in front of Agency.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
        Prior to the first running of the NDT Test users must reaccept the General Terms of Use and Privacy Policy of the Example Test Net, and thus explicitly accept
        that their data are processed and transmitted outside the EU, after which they need to check the "I wish to run the optional NDT test" checkbox. The user
        thereby explicitly accepts that during the NDT Test the IP address and other collected data (section 2.2.1) are processed and transmitted outside the EU.
        Users may withdraw their acceptance of the NDT Test at any time (in the app under Settings, by deactivating the NDT test option). Thereafter, only Example
        Test Net will be performed.
